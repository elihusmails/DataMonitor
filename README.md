This is a generic tool that can receive data in a specific format and graph the data over time.  I've used this many times in testing of network-based applications.  The code is very old and needs to be cleaned up, but at least its finally here and I can update it as I get free time to do so.


Currently using Apache MINA for the UDP network transport.  I'd like to add Apache Camel so that we could use TCP / UDP and various protocols to receive data.
